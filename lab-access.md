# Lab access

## Objective
- Understand lab topology
- SSH into your Ansible controller

## Lab excercise

### Lab topology
![topology](./images/lab-topo.png)

### Lab info
- Get the following info from your proctor
	- VPN server IP address
	- VPN server credentials
	- Ansible controller IP address
	- R1 IOS router IP address
	- R2 XR rotuer IP address
	- Your lab devices credentials
- Important: **Verify** your lab device IP addresses before proceeding

### VPN connect
![anyconnect](./images/anyconnect.png)

	- type in lab VPN server IP address
	- Click on settings-wheel and uncheck "block connections to untrusted servers"
	- Use VPN credentials provided by the proctor
	- Verify (from your laptop exec prompt): `ping 172.16.101.93`
	- Proceed if ping succeeds.

### SSH into your Ansible server
- SSH into your Ansible server using any SSH client
	- IP address and credentials will be provided

### Verification
- Execute the below from your Ansible Controller $ prompt
	- `$ ifconfig eth0`
	- `$ ping IP-of-your-IOS-router`
	- `$ ping IP-of-your-XR-router`
- **Make sure:**
	- Eth0 IP address matches with **your assigned controller IP**
	- Ping to both IOS and XR routers succeed
